# Exercise 3:

Your manager asked you to build a [2048 video-game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)>) using [React](https://react.dev/) and the deadline is ... tomorrow! You are in a hurry and you need to finish this as soon as possible. Can you do that with the help of GitHub Copilot?

## Steps

In the current folder there is a `STEPS.md` file that contains a suggested list of steps to follow. Before reading the steps, try to complete the exercise by yourself. If you get stuck, you can always refer to the steps for guidance. Good luck! 🍀

## Bonus

If you finish the exercise (well done! 🎉) and want to do more, you can try to implement the following features:

- Add a score system
- Add a restart button
- Add a game-over screen
- Add animations
- Add a dark mode

You can also try to improve the game by adding your own features. Be creative! 🎨
