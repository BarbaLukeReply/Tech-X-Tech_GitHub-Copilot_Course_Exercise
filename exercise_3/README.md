# Exercise 3:

Your manager asked you to build a [2048 video-game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)>) using [React](https://react.dev/) and the deadline is ... tomorrow! You are in a hurry and you need to finish this as soon as possible. Can you do that with the help of GitHub Copilot?

## Steps

In the current folder there is a `STEPS.md` file that contains a suggested list of steps to follow. Before reading the steps, try to complete the exercise by yourself. If you get stuck, you can always refer to the steps for guidance. Good luck! üçÄ
