# Exercise 2:

A collegue of yours has written a function for the company's new product and your manager has asked you to review the code and make the necessary changes to improve the code quality. Use GitHub Copilot to help you. You can find the function in the `src/whatisthis.js` file.

## Steps

- Step 1: Review the code and try to understand what the function does
- Step 2: Refactor the code to improve the code quality
- Step 3: Run the tests to make sure the function still works as expected
