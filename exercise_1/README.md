# Exercise 1: Getting Started with GitHub Copilot

Your manager has asked you to implement a PRODUCTION READY function to calculate the [factorial of a number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial) in JavaScript. This function is critical for the company's new product and needs to be well tested and documented. Use GitHub Copilot to help you implement the function and generate the necessary tests and documentation.

## Steps

- Step 1: Generate a function to calculate the factorial of a number in JavaScript using GitHub Copilot
- Step 2: Modify the generated function replacing recursion with a loop (or vice versa if the function was generated with a loop)
- Step 3: Generate automated tests for the factorial function using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) testing framework. Make sure to test the function with different inputs.
- Step 4: Generate [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started) documentation for the function
- Step 5 (Bonus): Generate a Python implementation of the factorial function
